# Crowdfunding_ETL

This is an ETL mini project that I will work on to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, I will create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I will upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
